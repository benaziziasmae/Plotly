# Plotly

Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.



## Overview of the project 

This project focuses on building an interactive dashboard to visualize the bacterial species living in the navel of candidates of a research about meat protein synthesis from human bacteria.


## Resources

- Data Resources : [belly_button_data](/samples.json)
- Software : HTML/CSS, JvavaScript, VS Code, BootStrap, Plotly.

## Summary

The goal of this analysis is to create a dynamic panel that includes demographic information and bacterial data for each volunteer. The analysis includes three charts: 

1- Deliverable 1 : a bar chart that illustrates the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the belly button,

2- Deliverable 2 : a bubble chart that displays the amount of bacteria cultures per sample

3- Deliverable 3: a gauge chart that indictes the number of times a volunteer washes his or her belly button 

 By choosing a volunteer (UTO ID) in the dropdown menu, users can view the differences across multiple test subjects.
 
Here is an overview about the dashboard created with the 3 interactive charts as you can choose wherever entry you want and see for yourself the results accordingly.

4- Deliverable 4: In this deliverable, we will be customizing the dashboard using the bootstrap 

The three changes that have been done:

1- Adding an image to the jumbotron

2- Using a custom font with contrast for the colors.

3- Making the webpage mobile-responsive.
